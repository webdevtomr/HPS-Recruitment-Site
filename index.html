                    <h2>HPS Recruitment – Perth's Trusted Labour Hire & Recruitment Agency</h2>

                    <p>The growing demand for outsourced workers has made labour hire one of the fastest-growing solutions for businesses across Australia. Once mainly focused on construction, labour hire is now relied upon in industries ranging from logistics and manufacturing through to healthcare, engineering, and mining.</p>

                    <p>HPS Recruitment is a Perth-based labour hire and recruitment agency that stands apart through our specialised approach, commitment to client satisfaction, and unwavering integrity.</p>

                    <h3>Why Businesses Choose Us</h3>
                    <p>Companies turn to HPS Recruitment when they need reliable workers—fast. Whether it's to cover long-term absences, handle seasonal peaks, or meet urgent project deadlines, we deliver qualified and competent staff at short notice with minimal fuss.</p>

                    <h3>Our Workforce</h3>
                    <p>Over the years, HPS has built a diverse database of skilled and unskilled employees ready to step into roles across industries—from trades, plant operators, and civil construction, to logistics, warehousing, oil & gas, engineering, and more. For specialist placements, we carefully match only the right candidate to the right role—never "square pegs in round holes."</p>

                    <h3>The Benefits of Labour Hire with HPS</h3>
                    <p>Recruiting directly can be costly and time-consuming, involving advertising, vetting, training, and compliance. By partnering with HPS, you save valuable time and money. We handle:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recruitment, vetting, and training</li>
                        <li>Payroll and tax obligations</li>
                        <li>Superannuation and entitlements</li>
                        <li>Workers' compensation and insurance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Our transparent pricing means no hidden charges, ever.</p>

                    <h3>Industry Experience</h3>
                    <p>We have extensive experience supplying labour hire in Perth's construction and civil sectors, ensuring seamless onboarding and no disruption to projects. Beyond short-term placements, HPS also offers permanent recruitment services for long-term roles, applying a meticulous process to find the right cultural and technical fit.</p>

                    <h3>Our Reputation</h3>
                    <p>Strong client relationships are the foundation of our success. HPS Recruitment has become one of Perth's most trusted staffing agencies by consistently delivering what our clients need, time after time. Much of our business comes from referrals—a reflection of our reliability and service.</p>

                    <h3>24/7 Support</h3>
                    <p>Staffing challenges don't keep business hours, and neither do we. Our team is available 24/7 to ensure you're never left without support.</p>

                    <h3>The HPS Difference</h3>
